### Steps to create a build
*Don't type the `$`, playa', it's just a little extra bling* :moneybag:

1. `$ git pull` Make sure you're in the right directory, dummy. :dancer: 
2. `$ cd webapp` Always pull latest version first
3. `$ npm install` Installs dependencies used by grunt to run its tasks and make the build
4. `$ grunt build` Spits out a build to the dist folder

### Create a build on Ubuntu
#### It's goes without saying - node and npm are required. There is a lot of ways to install that so I'm not going to write a guide about it.

1. `sudo apt-get install ruby-full` You have to install ruby
2. `sudo gem isntall compass`
3. `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
4. `cd webapp`
5. `sudo npm install`
6. `sudo grunt server`
